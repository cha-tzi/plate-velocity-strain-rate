# plate-velocity-strain-rate
This program analyses the past forty years of earthquakes in the NW Pacific plate boundary (near Japan). The aim of the program is to use this data and determine the seismically calculated plate velocity and second invariant of strain. This program was created as part of assesment for the Advanced Programming Course in Imperial College London
